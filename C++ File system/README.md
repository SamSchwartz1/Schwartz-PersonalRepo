This is a file system made in C++ I made as a part of my Object Oriented Programming Class.

The overall Lab5.sln file runs all the commands one could expect to see in a basic linux-esque file system

The shared code folder features files made and worked on throughout the project with my partner Sydney and contains a lot of the functionality for commands.
